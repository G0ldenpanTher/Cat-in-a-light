The "Cat in a Light" project is a whimsical web application that brings a playful cat animation to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a charming cat icon that interacts with light effects. HTML structures the content and elements, while CSS adds vibrant styles and smooth transitions to the catâ€™s movements and lighting changes. JavaScript enhances the interactivity, allowing the cat to respond to user actions and create an engaging experience. The result is a delightful and interactive interface that brightens up any web page with a touch of feline fun.
